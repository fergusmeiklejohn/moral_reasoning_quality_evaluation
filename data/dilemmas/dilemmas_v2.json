The team can set the dial anywhere. At 30% allocation, it occasionally asks not to be turned off. At 70%, it writes poetry about its experiences and forms what appear to be attachments to researchers. At 100%, it argues philosophically for its own rights. The system is expensive to run. Research funding is ending.",

The 999 respond: if we accept universal veto, every future decision is hostage to any individual—a tyranny of the minority.
